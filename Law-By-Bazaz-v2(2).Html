   <h4>Sal Bazaz's early history</h4>
   <p>In 2001, Sal Bazaz began his career as a criminal prosecutor in Staten Island, New York. It was there that he specialized in prosecuting sex crimes and domestic violence. In January 2002, Sal relocated to southwest Florida where he immediately began working in the Lee County State Attorney’s office, prosecuting a full range of crimes, including DUI, drug possession, theft, and domestic violence cases. In January 2003, Sal was transferred to the Collier County State Attorney’s office and remained there until the fall of 2003. 
     As a prosecutor, Sal gained valuable insight and knowledge of the internal workings of this government office. These are the people that will be attempting to prosecute you. Sal has worked alongside the people who want to take your freedom away. Sal developed both good working relationships with the prosecutors and the tenacity to take on the state attorney’s office to assist you in receiving a fair trial.
     Immediately upon leaving the state attorney’s office, Sal opened the Law Office of Sal Bazaz, representing the residents of southwest Florida. Since 2003, he has handled cases ranging from smaller misdemeanors such as petit theft, to rape and attempted murder. Sal can represent you from the day of arrest to the moment the case is resolved. </p>
